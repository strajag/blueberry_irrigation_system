problems

version 0-1-8
	-tested

changes
	-changed in all files all "debug_printf" functions to "debug_log" macro as now debugging in "my-library.h" is updated
	-changed in "my-library.h" debugging level to 0
	-changed in "internet.c" in "internet_send()" function all "debug_log(udp.write())" functions to just "udp.write()" as there was problem when "my-library.h" is updated to use "debug_log()" instead of "debug_printf()" that cause to send wrong data to server
	-removed in "control-irrigation-temp.c" supplement pump and water valve from turning on/off when program is "CONTROL_IRRIGATION_TEMP_PROGRAM_CLEANING" as now supplement pump cleaning is not needed 
	-changed in "control-flow.c" supplements micro to be controlled by click pump instead of supplements pump and adjusted code in "control_flow_start()" and "control_flow_update()" for that change as now click pump controls micro and supplement pump/valves control macro supplement

known bugs
	-(fixed)in "control-irrigation-temp.c" code is not removed to stop using water valve for cleaning so water valve is turning on/off when program is "CONTROL_IRRIGATION_TEMP_PROGRAM_CLEANING" in "control_irrigation_temp_resume()" and "control_irrigation_temp_update()" function

version 0-1-7

version 0-1-4
	-tested

notes
	-arduino wire from reset pin to pin 48 is removed and ethernet reset pin is removed from pin 49 and wired with arduino reset pin as temporary solution for ethernet shield reset arduino freeze bug

changes
    -changed in internet.h INTERNET_REMOTE_HOSTNAME from straykovsky.my.to to straykovsky.ddns.net as now i am using noip.com dns service instead of freedns.afraid.org as TTL from noip is 60s unlike freedns 1h

version 0-1-3
    -tested at field

changes
    -removed http send and receive code in internet header and source as now i have domain that points directly to my server ip and adjusted internet header and source code according to that change
    -adjusted internet header and source code
    -added internet_troubleshoot() function in internet.h/c to detect and fix problem with internet connection
    -adjusted internet_receive() function in internet.h/c to check is packet received from same ip as remote server ip
    -adjusted internet_ip_remote_update() function in internet.h/c to return bool_t instead of void on success
    -added status ready check in internet_ip_remote_update() and internet_send() function in internet.h/c

    -added stop function in control-irrigation-temp.h/c

todo
    -code udp data parity check or checksum or any error detection shit in internet.h/c

known bugs
    -(fixed)in internet.h/c in internet_update() function if i dont put delay() after digitalWrite(INTERNET_PIN_RESET, HIGH); then dhcp will fail on W5100 when calling internet_restart_hard() function, W5500 isn't tested
    -(fixed)when ip of hostname is changed then dns needs time (about 1h) to revalidate ip

notes
    -in internet.h/c if any function from ethernet/udp library (stop, receive, read, write...) is called before hardware initialization or after hardware reset (hardware.begin, udp.begin, connect...) then program will freeze

version 0-1-1
	-tested at field
	
problems
	-(fixed)there is no flow thought valves on supplements pump as there is no enough pressure to lift membrane in valves
	-(fixed)noise from switching on/off 220v supplements pump and 12v click pump with secondary (not 5v arduino relay) relay is triggering interrupt
	-(fixed)noise from switching on/off main well pump with switch (not with relay or with pressure relay) is triggering interrupt

known bugs
	-when supplement water flow meter is counting pulses then well flow meter is also counting same pulses as they are on same pin

changes
	-as valves on supplements pump didn't work (not enough pressure to open valve) flow-control is changed to switch on/off supplements pump instead of valves as valves are removed
	-adjusted pulses per liter for micro and macro sensor-flow
	-adjusted valves minimum switch time from 1 to 2 seconds
	-added option to serial print sensor-flow pulses
	-added one debug_printf in flow-control update() function to serial print when flow-control is finished

version 0-1-0
	-checkpoint
	-tested at home
	-not used on field

possible bugs
	-what will happen if flow-control is resumed without previous pausing
